# JN Soundboard
A program written in C# using the NAudio library that uses hotkeys to play sounds into a chosen sound device. It is similar to [EXP Soundboard](https://sourceforge.net/projects/expsoundboard/), except that JN Soundboard is not as cross-platform as EXP, but, there are more features in JN than EXP.

How to play sound effects over microphone:
You can't really play it "over" the microphone, however you can route them both through a virtual audio cable.
To do that, first install a virtual audio cable (I recommend VB-Audio's Cable & Voicemeeter)[VB-CABLE](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm), [VB-Voicemeeter](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/index.htm).
Voicemeeter has multiple uses and one is routing audio devices into a virtual device to "play over the microphone" in a way.
set the playback device to the virtual audio cable, then set the loopback device to your microphone, if you are using voicemeeter you do not need a loopback device.
Lastly, in the application that is going to use the microphone, set the microphone device to "VB-Audio Virtual Cable" or "VB-Audio VoiceMeeter".
